<h1><ul>AKAN'S NAMING CULTURE!!!!!!</ul></h1>
</div>
  <div class="row"> 

   <div class="col-md-8">  The Akan are a meta-ethnicity living in the southern <br>regions
        of present-day Ghana and Ivory Coast <br>in West Africa. The Akan language is a group
         <br>of dialects within the Central 
       Tano branch of the Potou–Tano subfamily of the Niger–Congo family.
    
    <br></br>
    <h2>Origin and Ethnogenesis</h2>
    
    The greater Akan people (macro-ethnic group) speak Kwa languages. 
    The proto-Kwa language is believed to have
come from East/Central Africa, before settling in the Sahel.
 The people who became known as the Akan migrated
from the Sahel to coastal west Africa. The kingdom of Bonoman was firmly 
established in the 12th century by the
Akan people. Bonoman was a trading state between the Akan and neighboring 

people especially those from Djenné.
During different phases of the Bonoman empire groups of Akans migrated 
out of the area to create numerous states
based predominantly on gold mining and trading of farm products.

        <p class="p">The Akan naming system is a culture that was developed by the Ghananians. Children were given a
            "day name"
            which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. The tradition was shared out through-out west
            Africa and the African Diaspora. Notable figures with Akan names include Ghana's first president Kwame
            Nkrumah
            and former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan. </p>
